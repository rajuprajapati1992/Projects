            <p class="text-small">By 2030, India will have the largest number of young population in the globe, a
                population size that will be a boon only if these young people are skilled enough to join the workforce.
                Quality education will play a major role in it. But the current state of Education faces major
                challenges like lack of adequate infrastructure, low government expenditure on education (less than 3.5%
                of the GDP) and as per the Unified District Information System For Education (UDISE) the
                pupil-to-teacher ratio at the national level for elementary schools is 24:1. So it's high time to tune
                the Indian Education System with global standards and adopt modern learning approaches that are
                responsive and relevant. Also, vitalise National Education Policy 2020 to see the light of day.</p>
